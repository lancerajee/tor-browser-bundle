This directory contains a special headless configuration of the Tor
Browser app, intended for use by meek-client-torbrowser and the
meek-http-helper extension. It should not be run directly.

Almost all files in this directory are simply symlinked to their
counterparts in ../TorBrowser.app. The only exceptions are this README
and the file Info.plist. Info.plist contains an additional configuration
directive that prevents the headless browser from opening a useless
second dock icon:
	<key>LSBackgroundOnly</key><true/>

For background on this matter, see the ticket:
