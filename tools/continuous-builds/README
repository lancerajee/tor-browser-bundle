Nightly builds can be produced and uploaded to a publishing host by
running build-tbb.sh. The checkout-tbb.sh script can be used to check
out the latest master before starting a build.

The publishing host should handle uploaded tar file using the
park-nightly.sh script through the command option in sshd's
AuthorizedKeysFile.

  command="[ $(hostname) = perdulce ] && ~/park-nightly.sh",no-pty ssh-rsa ...

In order to not grow the disk usage too much on the publishing host,
the following script can be run by cron:
